The Effects of Food Deprivation on Concentration and Perseverance
Thomas Delancy and Adam Solberg Dordt College
Abstract
This study examined the effects of short-term food deprivation on two cognitive abilities—
concentration and perseverance. Undergraduate students (N-51) were tested on both a concentration
task and a perseverance task after one of three levels of food deprivation: none, 12 hours, or 24 hours.
We predicted that food deprivation would impair both concentration scores and perseverance time.
Food deprivation had no significant effect on concentration scores, which is consistent with recent
research on the effects of food deprivation (Green et al., 1995; Green et al., 1997). However,
participants in the 12-hour deprivation group spent significantly less time on the perseverance task
than those in both the control and 24-hour deprivation groups, suggesting that short-term deprivation
may affect some aspects of cognition and not others.
Introduction
(Para. 1) Many things interrupt people’s ability to focus on a task: distractions, headaches,
noisy environments, and even psychological disorders. To some extent, people can control the
environmental factors that make it difficult to focus. However, what about internal factors, such as an
empty stomach? Can people increase their ability to focus simply by eating regularly? （ ）
(Para. 2) One theory that prompted research on how food intake affects the average person was
the glucostatic theory. Several researchers in the 1940s and 1950s suggested that the brain regulates
food intake in order to maintain a blood-glucose set point. The idea was that people become hungry
when their blood-glucose levels drop significantly below their set point and that they become
satisfied after eating, when their blood-glucose levels return to that set point. This theory seemed
logical because glucose is the brain’s primary fuel (Pinel, 2000).
(Para.3)The earliest investigation of the general effects of food deprivation found that
long-term food deprivation (36 hours and longer) was associated with sluggishness, depression,
irritability, reduced heart rate, and inability to concentrate (Keys, Brozek, Henschel, Mickelsen, &
Taylor, 1950). Another study found that fasting for several days produced muscular weakness,
irritability, and apathy or depression (Kollar, Slater, Palmer, Docter, & Mandell, 1964). Since that
time, research has focused mainly on how nutrition affects cognition. However, as Green, Elliman,
and Rogers (1995) point out, the effects of food deprivation on cognition have received
comparatively less attention in recent years. （ ）
(Para. 4) The relatively sparse research on food deprivation has left room for further research.
First, much of the research has focused either on chronic starvation at one end of the continuum or
on missing a single meal at the other end (Green et al., 1995). Second, some of the findings have
been contradictory. One study found that skipping breakfast impairs certain aspects of cognition,
such as problem-solving abilities (Pollitt, Lewis, Garza, & Shulman, 1983). However, other research
by M. W. Green, N. A. Elliman, and P. J. Rogers (1995, 1997) has found that food deprivation
1ranging from missing a single meal to 24 hours without eating does not significantly impair
cognition. Third, not all groups of people have been sufficiently studied. Studies have been done on
9–11 year-olds (Pollitt et al., 1983), obese subjects (Crumpton, Wine, & Drenick, 1966), college-age
men and women (Green et al., 1995, 1996, 1997), and middle-age males (Kollar et al., 1964). Fourth,
not all cognitive aspects have been studied. In 1995 Green, Elliman, and Rogers studied sustained
attention, simple reaction time, and immediate memory; in 1996 they studied attention bias; and in
1997 they studied simple reaction time, two-finger tapping, recognition memory, and free recall. In
1983, another study focused on reaction time and accuracy, intelligence quotient, and problem
solving (Pollitt et al.). （ ） )
(Para.5) According to some researchers, most of the results so far indicate that cognitive
function is not affected significantly by short-term fasting (Green et al., 1995, p. 246). However, this
conclusion seems premature due to the relative lack of research on cognitive functions such as
concentration and perseverance. To date, no study has tested perseverance, despite its importance in
cognitive functioning. In fact, perseverance may be a better indicator than achievement tests in
assessing growth in learning and thinking abilities, as perseverance helps in solving complex
problems (Costa, 1984). Another study also recognized that perseverance, better learning techniques,
and effort are cognitions worth studying (D’Agostino, 1996). Testing as many aspects of cognition as
possible is key because the nature of the task is important when interpreting the link between food
deprivation and cognitive performance (Smith & Kendrick, 1992). （ ）
(Para.6) Therefore, the current study helps us understand how short-term food deprivation
affects concentration on and perseverance with a difficult task. Specifically, participants deprived of
food for 24 hours were expected to perform worse on a concentration test and a perseverance task
than those deprived for 12 hours, who in turn were predicted to perform worse than those who were
not deprived of food. （ ）

Methods
2Participants
Participants included 51 undergraduate-student volunteers (32 females, 19 males), some of
whom received a small amount of extra credit in a college course. The mean college grade point
average (GPA) was 3.19. Potential participants were excluded if they were dieting, menstruating, or
taking special medication. Those who were struggling with or had struggled with an eating disorder
were excluded, as were potential participants addicted to nicotine or caffeine.
Materials
Concentration speed and accuracy were measured using an online numbers-matching test
(www.psychtests.com/tests/iq/concentration.html) that consisted of 26 lines of 25 numbers each. In 6
minutes, participants were required to find pairs of numbers in each line that added up to 10. Scores
were calculated as the percentage of correctly identified pairs out of a possible 120. Perseverance
was measured with a puzzle that contained five octagons—each of which included a stencil of a
specific object (such as an animal or a flower). The octagons were to be placed on top of each other
in a specific way to make the silhouette of a rabbit. However, three of the shapes were slightly
altered so that the task was impossible. Perseverance scores were calculated as the number of
minutes that a participant spent on the puzzle task before giving up.
Procedure
At an initial meeting, participants gave informed consent. Each consent form contained an
assigned identification number and requested the participant’s GPA. Students were then informed
that they would be notified by e-mail and telephone about their assignment to one of the three
experimental groups. Next, students were given an instruction sheet. These written instructions,
which we also read aloud, explained the experimental conditions, clarified guidelines for the food
deprivation period, and specified the time and location of testing.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of these conditions using a matched-triplets design
based on the GPAs collected at the initial meeting. This design was used to control individual
differences in cognitive ability. Two days after the initial meeting, participants were informed of their
group assignment and its condition and reminded that, if they were in a food-deprived group, they
should not eat anything after 10 a.m. the next day. Participants from the control group were tested at
7:30 p.m. in a designated computer lab on the day the deprivation started. Those in the 12-hour group
were tested at 10 p.m. on that same day. Those in the 24-hour group were tested at 10:40 a.m. on the
following day.
At their assigned time, participants arrived at a computer lab for testing. Each participant was
given written testing instructions, which were also read aloud. The online concentration test had
already been loaded on the computers for participants before they arrived for testing, so shortly after
they arrived they proceeded to complete the test. Immediately after all participants had completed the
test and their scores were recorded, participants were each given the silhouette puzzle and instructed
how to proceed. In addition, they were told that (1) they would have an unlimited amount of time to
complete the task, and (2) they were not to tell any other participant whether they had completed the
3puzzle or simply given up. This procedure was followed to prevent the group influence of some
participants seeing others give up. Any participant still working on the puzzle after 40 minutes was
stopped to keep the time of the study manageable. Immediately after each participant stopped
working on the puzzle, he/she gave demographic information and completed a few
manipulation-check items. We then debriefed and dismissed each participant outside of the lab.

Results
4Perseverance data from one control-group participant were eliminated because she had to leave
the session early. Concentration data from another control-group participant were dropped because
he did not complete the test correctly. Three manipulation-check questions indicated that each
participant correctly perceived his or her deprivation condition and had followed the rules for it. The
average concentration score was 77.78 (SD = 14.21), which was very good considering that anything
over 50 percent is labeled “good” or “above average.” The average time spent on the puzzle was
24.00 minutes (SD = 10.16), with a maximum of 40
minutes allowed.
We predicted that participants in the 24-hour
deprivation group would perform worse on the
concentration test and the perseverance task than those in
the 12-hour group, who in turn would perform worse than
those in the control group. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) showed no significant effect of deprivation
condition on concentration, F (2, 46) = 1.06, p = .36 (see
Figure 1). Another one way ANOVA indicated a significant
effect of deprivation condition on perseverance time, F(2,47)
= 7.41, p < .05. Post-hoc Tukey tests indicated that the
12-hour deprivation group (M = 17.79, SD = 7.84) spent
significantly less time on the perseverance task than either
the control group (M = 26.80, SD = 6.20) or the 24-hour
group (M = 28.75, SD = 12.11), with no significant
difference between the latter two groups (see Figure 2). No
significant effect was found for gender either generally or
with specific deprivation conditions, Fs < 1.00. Unexpectedly, food deprivation had no significant
effect on concentration scores. Overall, we found support for our hypothesis that 12 hours of food
deprivation would significantly impair perseverance when compared to no deprivation. Unexpectedly,
24 hours of food deprivation did not significantly affect perseverance relative to the control group.
Also unexpectedly, food deprivation did not significantly affect concentration scores.
Discussion
1 The purpose of this study was to test how different levels of food deprivation affect
concentration on and perseverance with difficult tasks. We predicted that the longer people had been
deprived of food, the lower they would score on the concentration task, and the less time they would
spend on the perseverance task. In this study, those deprived of food did give up more quickly on the
puzzle, but only in the 12-hour group. Thus, the hypothesis was partially supported for the
perseverance task. However, concentration was found to be unaffected by food deprivation, and thus
the hypothesis was not supported for that task.
52 The findings of this study are consistent with those of Green et al. (1995), where short-term
food deprivation did not affect some aspects of cognition, including attentional focus. Taken together,
these findings suggest that concentration is not significantly impaired by short-term food deprivation.
The findings on perseverance, however, are not as easily explained. We surmise that the participants
in the 12-hour group gave up more quickly on the perseverance task because of their hunger
produced by the food deprivation. But why, then, did those in the 24-hour group fail to yield the
same effect? We postulate that this result can be explained by the concept of “learned
industriousness,” wherein participants who perform one difficult task do better on a subsequent task
than the participants who never took the initial task (Eisenberger & Leonard, 1980; Hickman,
Stromme, & Lippman, 1998). Because participants had successfully completed 24 hours of fasting
already, their tendency to persevere had already been increased, if only temporarily. Another possible
explanation is that the motivational state of a participant may be a significant determinant of
behavior under testing (Saugstad, 1967). This idea may also explain the short perseverance times in
the 12-hour group: because these participants took the tests at 10 p.m., a prime time of the night for
conducting business and socializing on a college campus, they may have been less motivated to take
the time to work on the puzzle.
3 Research on food deprivation and cognition could continue in several directions. First, other
aspects of cognition may be affected by short-term food deprivation, such as reading comprehension
or motivation. With respect to this latter topic, some students in this study reported decreased
motivation to complete the tasks because of a desire to eat immediately after the testing. In addition,
the time of day when the respective groups took the tests may have influenced the results: those in
the 24-hour group took the tests in the morning and may have been fresher and more relaxed than
those in the 12-hour group, who took the tests at night. Perhaps, then, the motivation level of
food-deprived participants could be effectively tested. Second, longer-term food deprivation periods,
such as those experienced by people fasting for religious reasons, could be explored. It is possible
that cognitive function fluctuates over the duration of deprivation. Studies could ask how long a
person can remain focused despite a lack of nutrition. Third, and perhaps most fascinating, studies
could explore how food deprivation affects learned industriousness. As stated above, one possible
explanation for the better perseverance times in the 24-hour group could be that they spontaneously
improved their perseverance faculties by simply forcing themselves not to eat for 24 hours. Therefore,
research could study how food deprivation affects the acquisition of perseverance.
4 In conclusion, the results of this study provide some fascinating insights into the cognitive and
physiological effects of skipping meals. Contrary to what we predicted, a person may indeed be very
capable of concentrating after not eating for many hours. On the other hand, if one is taking a long
test or working long hours at a tedious task that requires perseverance, one may be hindered by not
eating for a short time, as shown by the 12-hour group’s performance on the perseverance task. Many
people—students, working mothers, and those interested in fasting, to mention a few—have to deal
with short-term food deprivation, intentional or unintentional. This research and other research to
follow will contribute to knowledge of the disadvantages—and possible advantages—of skipping
6meals. The mixed results of this study suggest that we have much more to learn about short-term
food deprivation.
